This file contains 355 original kiwifruit flower images taken from Meixian Kiwifruit Experimental Station in Shaanxi province, China, from the seasons of “Xuxiang” (Actinidia deliciosa) kiwifruit flowering in 2021, in addition to 2,130 images (including 1,704 images for training) augmented by these 355 original images. The augmented methods selected here include image mirroring (including horizontal and vertical mirroring) and image rotation (including 90°, 180°, and 270° of rotation). The kiwifruit flowers and other objects in kiwifruit canopy were manually annotated as 14 classes in the images with rectangular annotations, and the image numbers from 000001 to 002130. Due to limited network resources, augmented images were uploaded by compressed 640x480 pixels, but original images were uploaded by original 3,456 × 2,304 pixels. The xml file number corresponds to the image number one to one, but it is not uploaded here, please contact fulsh@nwafu.edu.cn, longsheng.fu@wsu.edu if needed.
